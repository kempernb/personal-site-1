# Intro

My name is Nicholas Kemper. I am a recent graduate of the University of Cincinnati
where I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a degree in Chemical Engineering with a minor
in Business Analytics. I love researching, developing, and building cool tools
to make people's lives easier. I would love to get in contact with you!

# Some history

- I first knew that I was going to be an engineer at the age of 5. I won a national
[K'NEX](https://www.basicfun.com/knex/) building competition where I built a
dump truck with a fully functioning lift and everything. I still wish I could find this online ðŸ˜’.

- I still remember when I first used a computer way back in the day. Roller Coaster Tycoon was my favorite game ever. I spent countless hours building my theme parks.

- To be honest, I was not the best student growing up. I did not do well in classes such as social studies or english, I hated these classes. But math and science classes always clicked for me.

- I attended [St. Xavier High School](https://www.stxavier.org/) in Cincinnati at the age of 14. Here I played football and basketball. Somehow, I barely managed to pass Spanish but excelled in chemistry and math. This led me to pursue a degree in Chemical Engineering!

- After high school, I attended the University of Cincinnati where I pursued a degree in Chemical Engineering.

- During my first year of college, I ended joining a fraternity, [Sigma Phi Epsilon](https://sigep.org/). Here, I was able to develop a ton of leadership skills and meet some of my best friends to this day.

- Also during my first year of college, I applied and was a rewarded a research grant from the National Science Foundation. For this, I wrote a paper on using biomaterial use for medicine and drug applications. This was my area of research interest at the time, however this has now changed.

- I interned with [Silfex, a Division of Lam Research](https://www.silfex.com/) for 3 rotations in college. Here, I fell in love with technology and analytics and what led me to pursue a minor in Business Analytics.

- I also interned at [Givaudan SA](https://www.givaudan.com/) in their digital innovation department from 11/19 to 5/21. Here, I learned a ton about technology. Everything from machine learning to web development to internet of things devices. I fell in love with technology from this opportunity.

- In April of 2021, I graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Cincinnati with a degree in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Business Analytics.

- I started my career off at [Procter and Gamble](https://us.pg.com/) in June 2020 as an Associate Scientist in the Corporate Digital Innovation department where I focus on Data Activation and Science on our LIMS.

- I enjoy working on side project with my college friends. Recently, we launched [TrakPad](http://kck.st/3IdvSKZ) on Kickstarter. Although unsuccessful, I learned a ton in the process. My current venture is [Booking Anchor](https://www.bookinganchor.com/), a booking software targeted at Marinas.
